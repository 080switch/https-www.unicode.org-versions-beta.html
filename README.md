need to call in and approve direct express card.  new card issued 7/08/24 due to hacked and stolen by internet theft.  Tracking and tracing had been in process, in the meantime a free wifi service and other people in my building had been using the free wifi, suspected route where the hacking takes place.  did not get the new card on time to get my auto pay for phone service.  requested a free line while I have the new card replacement active, however the hacker may be going by the free wifi tied to this phone and my Chromebook.  Can I get a free line while I put this new card in?
